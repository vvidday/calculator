# calculator

Calculator project from The Odin Project (Foundations)

Things I learnt from this project:

- Not many new things, but it was very good practice to improve my existing knowledge
- Handling the calculator logic was quite tricky - had to keep track of quite a few states
- Functional abstraction is useful to avoid repeating myself too many times
